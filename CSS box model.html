       <p>CSS3 provides two ways to specify the size of an element. The default method—introduced way back in CSS1—applies the width and height values to the content box. That means that the resulting size of the element will be the dimensions you specify plus the amount of padding and borders that have been added to the element. The other method—introduced as part of the new box-sizing property in CSS3—applies the width and height values to the border box, which includes the content, padding, and border. With this method, the resulting visible element box, including padding and borders, will be exactly the dimensions you specify.</p><br>
       <span>NOTE:-In the green color there is padding, with red border and in black there is margin that we can see in the left top of the window(the space between window and border).</span>
